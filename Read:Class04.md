## What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
If multiple issues are occurring you should document everything before troubleshooting the issue. You should also ask the user what happen before, during, and after the issue to get a better understanding of the task at hand.
## What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
When you are able to identify the issue, then you should quickly implement the solution. Also create a plan to revert back to the original state incase things go wrong.
## What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
The benefit of documenting this issue is crucial, because if anyone else runs into the same exact problem, they can refer back to your notes to fix it quickly.
## Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-user’s cultural background?
If my iphone were to give me some issues I would first document the problem, then try to troubleshoot it by searching on google and youtube for the solution. Once I am able to find the correct steps to resolve my issue, I will send the link to others.Since most of the end user’s backgrounds are not particularly knowledgable on advanced technology, I would find a video or article that is easy to read and understand.
