## Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?
Windows usually uses anti virus and anti malware software. Mac OS uses third party tools to remove viruses and Linux uses user permissions and repositories for software installation and also uses anti virus tools. Windows typically has a larger user base which means higher frequencies of attacks, its a balance between user control and automated security measures. Mac OS integrates its security measures without overwhelming the user, so its easy to use. Linuxs is more for experts and values transparency and user control.
